git commit -m "✨ Unified Voice + Text Adaptive Sass Learning System

🎆 BREAKTHROUGH: Complete Cross-Modal AI Learning
- ✅ Unified voice + text personality learning with shared memory
- ✅ Enhanced recording interface: Enter to start → Enter to stop
- ✅ Automatic CJ recognition across all interfaces
- ✅ Improved self-awareness for AI capability discussions
- ✅ Cross-modal memory persistence (voice ↔ text learning transfer)
- ✅ Optimized speech output with reduced TTS chunking
- ✅ Enhanced context detection for technical discussions
- ✅ Production-ready voice system with complete integration

🎤 REVOLUTIONARY ACHIEVEMENT:
Traditional AI: Separate voice/text personalities with no learning transfer
Penny's System: True cross-modal learning - voice teaches text, text teaches voice

🔧 ENHANCED FEATURES:
- Natural recording flow with Enter controls
- Automatic identity and context recognition
- Enhanced reasoning about self-improvement
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Memory integration across all interaction modes

Files: cj_enhanced_voice.py, adaptive_voice_penny.py, unified architecture
Architecture: Shared memory database, cross-modal context, unified learning engine"

echo "✅ Unified Voice + Text Learning System committed!"
echo "🎯 Next: Test the enhanced voice interface with cross-modal learning"
