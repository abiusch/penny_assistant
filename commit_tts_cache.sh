git commit -m "⚡ Complete TTS Perceived Latency Polish - ChatGPT Priority #5

🎯 CHATGPT ROADMAP MILESTONE: 5/7 Priorities Complete
✅ Priority #1: Minimal personality layer (4 tones + safety)
✅ Priority #2: Daemon shim endpoints (FastAPI production-ready)
✅ Priority #3: SwiftUI menu-bar shell (code complete)
✅ Priority #4: First-run checks (comprehensive penny doctor)
✅ Priority #5: TTS perceived latency polish - JUST COMPLETED

⚡ TTS CACHING SYSTEM - INTELLIGENT LATENCY OPTIMIZATION:
✅ Phrase cache for ≤2-second phrases (exactly as ChatGPT specified)
✅ Background pregeneration thread with queue management
✅ Preserves existing barge-in behavior (non-blocking)
✅ Smart caching decisions (duration estimation, size limits)
✅ LRU eviction with usage statistics
✅ Thread-safe operations with proper locking

🚀 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
✅ Instant playback for cached phrases (no generation delay)
✅ Background pregeneration of common phrases
✅ 20 common phrases ready for immediate caching
✅ Cache persistence across application restarts
✅ Intelligent cache size management (configurable MB limit)

🔧 PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION:
✅ CachedGoogleTTS wrapper preserves all existing functionality
✅ Seamless integration with current TTS pipeline
✅ Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
✅ Cache statistics and hit rate monitoring
✅ Complete test suite with integration and performance tests

📊 CACHING FEATURES:
✅ MD5-based cache keys (case-insensitive, voice-aware)
✅ Automatic eviction based on usage patterns and age
✅ Background worker thread for non-blocking pregeneration
✅ Priority queuing for high-importance phrases
✅ Cache warming for conversation-specific phrases
✅ Metadata persistence for cross-session caching

🧪 COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:
✅ Unit tests for cache logic and thread safety
✅ Integration tests with file operations
✅ Performance benchmark and validation script
✅ Mock TTS integration testing
✅ Background processing validation

🎯 Key Innovation: Makes responses feel instant without over-engineering
- Common phrases (Hello, Thank you, etc.) play immediately
- Background generation prevents perceived delays
- Maintains all existing TTS functionality
- Configurable and production-ready

Files Added:
- src/adapters/tts/cache.py: Comprehensive TTS caching system (500+ lines)
- src/adapters/tts/cached_google_tts.py: Enhanced TTS adapter with caching
- tests/test_tts_cache.py: Complete test suite for caching functionality
- test_tts_cache.py: Performance validation and demo script

Next: ChatGPT Priority #6 (Calendar improvements) and #7 (CI/docs cleanup)"
