# PennyGPT Session Summary - August 22, 2025

## Session Overview
Continued development from August 20, 2025 session where voice assistant was made functional. Today focused on adding Text-to-Speech and resolving repository structure issues.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Text-to-Speech Integration
- Connected gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to the voice pipeline
- Created `penny_with_tts.py` that speaks responses aloud
- Full conversation loop now working: Voice → Whisper → Ollama → TTS → Audio output
- Tested and confirmed working (though responses are verbose for voice)

### 2. Repository Cleanup
- Resolved nested repository confusion (had `PennyGPT-Project` subdirectory inside `penny_assistant`)
- Renamed GitHub repository from `PennyGPT-Project` to `penny_assistant` for consistency
- Removed nested directory structure
- Successfully pushed all working code to GitHub
- Repository now at: https://github.com/abiusch/penny_assistant

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Consolidated multiple summary files into single `COPILOT_BRIEF.md`
- Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for AI assistant context
- Cleaned up redundant documentation files
- Updated `.gitignore` for Python project standards

## Current Working State
The voice assistant has these working components:
- **Audio Input**: MacBook Pro microphone (device 1)
- **Speech Recognition**: Whisper (base model) - shows FP16/FP32 warning but works fine
- **LLM**: Ollama with llama3 model providing intelligent responses
- **Text-to-Speech**: gTTS converting responses to speech
- **Full Pipeline**: Complete conversation loop functional

## Working Commands
```bash
# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run voice assistant with TTS
PYTHONPATH=src python penny_with_tts.py

# Run tests (all 11 passing)
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q tests --ignore=whisper --tb=short
```

## Known Issues
- Audio detection sometimes requires multiple attempts (silence threshold at 0.005)
- Whisper shows FP16/FP32 warning (harmless, just means using CPU instead of GPU)
- LLM responses too verbose for voice output (needs prompt tuning)
- macOS accessibility permissions still needed for keyboard shortcuts
- Python 3.13 compatibility warnings (everything works but 3.11 recommended)

## Repository Structure
```
penny_assistant/
├── src/
│   ├── core/           # Pipeline, routing, personality
│   └── adapters/       # LLM, STT, TTS adapters
├── tests/              # All passing
├── penny_with_tts.py   # Main working script with TTS
├── penny_config.json   # Configuration
├── COPILOT_BRIEF.md    # Development documentation
└── pyproject.toml      # Package configuration
```

## Next Development Priorities
1. Wake word detection ("Hey Penny")
2. Keyboard shortcuts (needs macOS permissions)
3. Conversation memory/context
4. Agent mode implementation
5. Response length optimization for voice

## Git Status
- All changes committed and pushed to main branch
- Repository: https://github.com/abiusch/penny_assistant
- Clean working tree, no nested repos
- Force push was used to replace old broken code with working version

## Key Technical Decisions
- Using `PYTHONPATH=src` pattern for imports
- Silence threshold set to 0.005 for audio detection
- Using subprocess for TTS playback (afplay on macOS)
- LocalLLM adapter properly calls Ollama via subprocess
- Consolidated to single `src/` layout (removed duplicate directories)

This session successfully added voice output capability and resolved all repository management issues. The voice assistant is now fully functional with bidirectional audio communication.
