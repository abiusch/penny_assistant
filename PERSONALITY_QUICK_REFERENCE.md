## 🎭 What Penny Learns

After 10+ conversations, Penny knows:
- Are you casual or formal?
- Do you prefer simple or technical?
- What's your favorite slang?
- Morning person or night owl?
- Do you like encouragement or straight facts?
- What response styles work best for you?

## 🔮 What Phase 2 Would Add

Make Penny actually USE what she learned:
- Uses your vocabulary and slang
- Matches your formality preference
- Adjusts technical depth automatically
- Adapts to time of day / context
- Celebrates learning milestones

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- ✅ **Zero behavior change** in Phase 1
- ✅ **All local** - no external data sharing
- ✅ **Removable** - just delete the lines
- ✅ **Safe** - confidence scoring + rate limiting
- ✅ **Fast** - async, no performance impact

## 🎓 Quick Troubleshooting

**"Module not found"**

**"No data found"**

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Check learning every 10 messages for best insights
- More conversations = better patterns
- Works best with varied topics and times
- Review recommendations after 20+ messages
