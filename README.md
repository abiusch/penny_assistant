### 4. Try These for Maximum Personality Experience

**Tech Industry Roasting:**
- "Should I use microservices for everything?"
- "What's the best JavaScript framework?"

**Learning & Curiosity:**
- "I'm working on a FastAPI project"
- "Tell me about machine learning"

**Relationship Building:**
- "My dad thinks programming is just games"
- "I'm stressed about work"

## 🎭 Personality Examples

**Before Enhancement:**
```
User: "Should I use microservices for everything?"
Basic AI: "Microservices can be beneficial but also add complexity. Consider your specific use case..."
```

**With PennyGPT's Personality:**
```
User: "Should I use microservices for everything?"
Penny: "Oh hell no! Microservices for everything? That's like using a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame. 
Sure, Netflix does it because they have armies of engineers, but you're not Netflix. Start with a damn monolith 
that actually works, then split it when you have real scaling problems, not imaginary ones."
```

## 🧠 Advanced Companion Features

### **Permission-Based Research System**
```python
# Auto-approves research for your interests
"Research FastAPI? Sure, I'll do the heavy lifting while you sit there looking pretty. Interested?"

# Asks permission for new topics  
"Want me to dive into blockchain? I can research it if you're curious about that particular rabbit hole."
```

### **Learning from Corrections**
```python
# Detects when corrected and learns
User: "Actually, it's React, not Angular"
Penny: "Ah, React! Thanks for the correction - I'll remember that for next time. 
React hooks are pretty slick, aren't they?"
```

### **Proactive Curiosity with Boundaries**
```python
# Meaningful follow-up questions
"What's your actual plan with FastAPI, or are we just winging it?"
"Speaking of Python, have you tried the new structural pattern matching in 3.10+?"
```

### **Personal Profile Integration**
```python
# Knows your context and projects
"Given your FastAPI background, you'd probably love Pydantic v2's performance improvements."
"This reminds me of that PennyGPT project you're working on..."
```

## 📊 System Architecture

### **Core Pipeline**
```
Audio Input → VAD → Whisper STT → Wake Word → Command Extract → 
Enhanced LLM + Memory + Emotional Intelligence + Personality → TTS → Audio Output
```
