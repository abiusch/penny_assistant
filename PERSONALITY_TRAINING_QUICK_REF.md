# 🎯 Quick Reference: Training Penny's Personality

## 📊 Current Status
- **Conversations:** 14
- **Confidence:** 0.30-0.34
- **Threshold:** 0.65
- **Status:** Learning (not adapting yet)
- **Needed:** 15-20 more conversations

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Conversations Right Now)

### 1. Casual Tone
```
"hey penny, quick question - what's your take on TypeScript vs JavaScript? ngl I'm conflicted"
```

### 2. Technical Depth
```
"can you explain async/await in detail? I want to understand how it works under the hood"
```

### 3. Vocabulary
```
"help me refactor this function: def calc(x,y): return x+y
It works but could be cleaner. LGTM when you're done"
```

---

## 💡 Key Principles

### ✅ Do This:
- Use consistent vocabulary ("refactor" always, not sometimes "rewrite")
- Be casual and natural (how you actually talk)
- Mix technical + casual + humor
- Use slang consistently ("ngl", "fr", "tbh", "lmk")

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Switch between formal and casual randomly
- Only ask test questions
- Expect instant changes
- Use vocabulary inconsistently

## 📅 Sample Conversations (Copy/Paste Ready)

### **Casual Tech (Use 3-5 times)**
```
"yo penny, can you help me refactor this code?"
"what's your take on tabs vs spaces? ngl I'm a spaces person"
"sup - quick question about REST vs GraphQL"
"this approach seems off, got any other ideas?"
```

### **Technical Depth (Use 3-5 times)**
```
"explain database indexing - I want the performance details"
"walk me through how garbage collection works in Python"
"what are the trade-offs between these two patterns? give me specifics"
"break down this algorithm's time complexity step by step"
```

### **Practical Coding (Use 5-7 times)**
```
"I need to refactor this legacy function - where to start?"
"help me optimize this slow database query"
"review this code for me - does the logic look solid?"
"I'm debugging a race condition, any ideas?"
"this function needs better error handling - suggestions?"
```

### **Humor/Personality (Use 2-3 times)**
```
"tell me a programming joke - make it actually funny"
"roast my code" [share messy code]
"give me your hot take on JavaScript frameworks"
"be honest - how bad is this approach?"
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### **Watch These Numbers:**
```
🎭 Formality: 0.40 → [increases with data]
🧠 Tech: 0.50 → [adjusts to your preference]
📚 Terms: 59 → [grows as you talk more]
```

### **Console Indicators:**
```
✅ Good: "🎭 Personality-enhanced prompt applied"
✅ Good: "🎨 Response post-processed"
🎉 GREAT: "vocabulary_substitution, formality_adjustment"
    ↑ This means adaptations are being applied!
```

```
Before: "I suggest modifying this code..."
After: "You could refactor this..." ← YOUR vocabulary
```
