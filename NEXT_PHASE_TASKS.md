### **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR NEXT DEVELOPER**

#### **Emotional Intelligence System (Just Completed)**
- **Core File**: `emotional_memory_system.py` - Complete EI system with SQLite persistence
- **Integration**: `memory_enhanced_pipeline.py` - Enhanced with emotional context
- **Database**: New tables added to `data/memory.db`:
  - `emotional_context` - tracks emotions per conversation turn
  - `relationships` - family/friend information with emotional associations  
  - `value_alignments` - user's ethical framework and beliefs
  - `learning_goals` - topics for collaborative exploration
- **Usage**: Enhanced LLM context now includes emotional, relational, and value-based information

#### **Current Architecture**
```
Audio Input ‚Üí VAD ‚Üí Whisper STT ‚Üí Wake Word ‚Üí Command Extract ‚Üí 
LLM + Memory + Emotional Intelligence ‚Üí TTS ‚Üí Audio Output
```

#### **Key Integration Points**
- `MemoryEnhancedPipeline.think()` uses `get_enhanced_context_for_llm()` for emotional context
- `process_conversation_turn()` analyzes each conversation for emotional intelligence
- Relationship mentions, emotional states, and value alignments automatically tracked
- Enhanced memory stats include family members, learning goals, emotional patterns

#### **Infrastructure That Needs Strengthening**
- **Python 3.13**: Asyncio event loop warnings in test scripts
- **Database**: Add connection pooling and transaction safety for emotional tables
- **Performance**: Emotional analysis patterns could be optimized with caching
- **Error Handling**: Add graceful degradation if emotional system fails

- [ ] Code committed to GitHub

## Commands for Testing
```bash
# Environment setup
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q tests --ignore=whisper --tb=short

# Test wake word version
PYTHONPATH=src python penny_wake_word.py

# Test unified pipeline
PYTHONPATH=src python main.py
```

## Notes for Implementation
- Keep audio device setting at 1 (MacBook Pro Microphone)
- Silence threshold is 0.005 in `stt_engine.py`
- Use subprocess.run() for any system calls
- Maintain PYTHONPATH=src pattern for imports
- Python 3.13 works but shows warnings, 3.11 is preferred
