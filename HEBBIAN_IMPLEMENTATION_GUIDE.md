---

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue: Hebbian components not learning**

**Symptoms:**
- Associations staying at 0.0
- No entries in database
- Predictions always empty

**Solutions:**
1. Check feature flag: `FeatureFlags.is_hebbian_enabled()` returns True
2. Check observe() methods being called
3. Check database save() methods being called
4. Verify learning_rate > 0.0
5. Check database tables exist (run migration)

---

### **Issue: Performance slower than 10ms**

**Symptoms:**
- Conversations feel sluggish
- Logs show >10ms Hebbian overhead

**Solutions:**
1. Enable caching (check config: `cache_enabled: true`)
2. Reduce observation frequency
3. Batch database saves (increase `save_frequency`)
4. Add indexes to database queries
5. Profile with `cProfile` to find bottleneck

---

### **Issue: Associations not persisting**

**Symptoms:**
- Associations reset after restart
- Database tables empty

**Solutions:**
1. Check save_to_database() being called
2. Verify database path correct
3. Check save_frequency in config
4. Ensure no errors in database connection
5. Check file permissions on database

---

### **Issue: Wrong associations being made**

**Symptoms:**
- "ngl" suggested in formal context
- Inappropriate dimension predictions

**Solutions:**
1. Check competitive weakening working (decay_rate > 0)
2. Verify context classification accurate
3. Increase usage_threshold (default: 0.5)
4. Check activation_threshold for dimensions
5. May need to reset associations (clear database)

## 🎓 **LEARNING RESOURCES**

### **Hebbian Learning Fundamentals:**

**Core Principle:**
> "Neurons that fire together, wire together" - Donald Hebb, 1949

**Mathematical Form:**
```
Δw_ij = η * x_i * x_j

Where:
- Δw_ij = change in connection strength from neuron i to j
- η = learning rate
- x_i, x_j = activation levels of neurons i and j
```

**Applied to Penny:**
- Neurons = Terms, Dimensions, States
- Fire together = Co-occur in same conversation
- Wire together = Strengthen association in database

### **Competitive Learning:**

**Principle:**
When one association strengthens, competing associations weaken.

**Example:**
- "ngl" + casual context → strengthen (0.85)
- "ngl" + formal context → weaken (0.12)
- Result: System learns context-appropriate usage

### **Recommended Reading:**

1. Original Hebb paper concepts (1949)
2. Baby Dragon Hatchling paper (inspiration for this)
3. Sparse distributed memory (related concepts)
4. Associative learning in neural networks

3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM dimension_coactivations;`
4. Verify empathy + brevity co-activation strength increasing

**Test 3: Sequence Learning**
1. Have 3 conversations with pattern: problem → technical answer → "can you simplify?"
2. On 4th conversation, state a problem
3. Observe if Penny anticipates simplification need

---

## 💡 **TIPS & BEST PRACTICES**

### **Development:**

1. **Test each component independently first**
   - Don't integrate until all unit tests pass
   - Validate database operations separately
   - Check performance of each component alone

2. **Use feature flags liberally**
   - Test with Hebbian disabled first
   - Enable components one at a time
   - Easy rollback if issues occur

3. **Log everything initially**
   - Verbose logging during development
   - Track all observations and predictions
   - Can reduce logging after validation

4. **Start with conservative learning rates**
   - Default 0.05 is safe
   - Can increase after observing behavior
   - Too high = noisy, unstable learning

### **Debugging:**

1. **Use database views for inspection**
   - Views created by migration script
   - Easy way to see what's being learned
   - Check before and after conversations

2. **Profile performance early**
   - Use cProfile to find bottlenecks
   - Optimize hot paths first
   - Cache aggressively

3. **Test decay mechanisms**
   - Verify old associations weaken
   - Check competitive learning working
   - Prevent stale associations persisting

### **Maintenance:**

1. **Periodic database cleanup**
   - Remove associations below threshold (e.g., <0.1)
   - Archive old sequences
   - Vacuum database monthly

2. **Monitor for drift**
   - Track association strength distribution
   - Watch for runaway strengthening
   - Verify decay still working

3. **Update learning rates if needed**
   - Can adjust via config
   - Test changes with feature flag
   - Document adjustments
