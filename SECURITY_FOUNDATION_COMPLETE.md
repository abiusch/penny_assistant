## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY CAPABILITIES DEMONSTRATED**

### **Operation Classification Examples**
```
‚úÖ ALLOWED (GUEST): "read file config.json" ‚Üí file_read (SAFE)
‚úÖ ALLOWED (VERIFIED): "check system status" ‚Üí system_status (SAFE)
‚úÖ ALLOWED (TRUSTED): "write file output.txt" ‚Üí file_write (MEDIUM)
‚ùå BLOCKED (ANY): "access user credentials" ‚Üí credential_access (PROHIBITED)
‚ùå BLOCKED (GUEST): "execute system command" ‚Üí requires AUTHENTICATED
```

### **Intelligent Security Responses**
- **Educational blocks:** "I cannot perform 'system_modify' due to security restrictions"
- **Alternative suggestions:** "Try 'file_backup' before making changes"
- **Risk explanations:** "This operation requires 'authenticated' permission level"
- **Safety guidance:** "Consider using read-only operations first"

### **Multi-Layer Protection**
1. **Operation Recognition** - Pattern matching and classification
2. **Permission Validation** - User level vs required level
3. **Parameter Checking** - Input sanitization and validation
4. **Rate Limiting** - Prevents abuse and loops
5. **Audit Logging** - Complete decision trail
6. **Violation Response** - Educational and protective
