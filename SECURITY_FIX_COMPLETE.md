## 🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### **Fix 1: Enhanced Security Logging Import Mismatch** ⚡
**Issue**: Files importing `EnhancedSecurityLogging` but class was named `EnhancedSecurityLogger`
**Solution**: Updated import statements with alias mapping
**Files Fixed**:
- `rate_limiting_resource_control.py`
- `rollback_recovery_system.py`
- `advanced_authentication_system.py`
- `lm_studio_performance_monitor.py`
- `runaway_process_detector.py`
- `adaptive_rate_limiting_system.py`

**Change Applied**:
```python
# Before:
from enhanced_security_logging import EnhancedSecurityLogging

# After:
from enhanced_security_logging import EnhancedSecurityLogger as EnhancedSecurityLogging
```

### **Fix 2: Machine Learning Dependencies** ⚡
**Issue**: `predictive_security_analytics.py` required `sklearn` package
**Solution**: Installed scikit-learn with dependencies
**Command**: `pip3 install scikit-learn numpy pandas`
**Result**: C2 Predictive Security Analytics now functional

### **Fix 3: Test File Typing Issues** ⚡
**Issue**: Test files missing `List` type import
**Solution**: Added proper typing imports
**Files Fixed**:
- `test_phase_b1_operational_security.py`
- `test_phase_c_intelligence_integration.py`
