git commit -m "🏥 Complete Penny Doctor - First-Run Checks System

🎯 CHATGPT ROADMAP PRIORITY #4 COMPLETE: First-Run Checks
✅ Comprehensive system health validation tool
✅ Prevents head-scratching troubleshooting sessions
✅ Validates entire PennyGPT setup in single command

🔍 Comprehensive Health Checks:
✅ Python environment (version, venv, PYTHONPATH)
✅ Dependencies (FastAPI, PyAudio, OpenAI, etc.)
✅ Audio system (microphone, speakers, permissions)
✅ LLM services (LM Studio, Ollama connectivity)
✅ Text-to-Speech (gTTS functionality)
✅ PennyGPT components (files, imports, server)
✅ FastAPI daemon (endpoints, health, PTT control)
✅ macOS permissions (microphone access)

🛠️ Multiple Access Methods:
✅ Shell wrapper: ./scripts/doctor.sh
✅ Direct execution: python3 penny_doctor.py
✅ Module import: python -m core.doctor
✅ PYTHONPATH integration for clean imports

📊 Smart Output & Diagnostics:
✅ Color-coded results (✅❌) with detailed explanations
✅ Fix suggestions for every failed check
✅ Health summary with pass/fail counts
✅ Exit codes for CI/CD integration
✅ Quick fixes section for common issues

🧪 Production-Ready Testing:
✅ Comprehensive test suite (test_penny_doctor.py)
✅ Mock-based testing for external dependencies
✅ Integration testing with real system components
✅ Syntax validation and import testing
✅ Demo mode for quick validation

📚 Complete Documentation:
✅ Detailed usage guide (docs/PENNY_DOCTOR.md)
✅ Common issues and fixes
✅ Workflow integration examples
✅ CI/CD pipeline integration
✅ Exit code reference

🎯 ChatGPT Roadmap Progress - 4/7 Priorities Complete:
1. ✅ Minimal personality layer (4 tones + safety)
2. ✅ Daemon shim endpoints (FastAPI production-ready)
3. ✅ SwiftUI menu-bar shell (native macOS integration)  
4. ✅ First-run checks (comprehensive penny doctor)

💡 Key Innovation: Single Command System Validation
- Identifies setup issues before they cause problems
- Provides specific fix suggestions for every issue
- Validates entire stack: Python → Audio → LLM → TTS → Daemon
- Perfect for new users, deployment, and development workflow

🚀 Workflow Integration Ready:
- First-time setup validation
- Pre-development environment checks
- Pre-deployment health verification
- CI/CD pipeline health gates

Files Added:
- penny_doctor.py: Comprehensive health checker (400+ lines)
- scripts/doctor.sh: Shell wrapper for easy access
- src/core/doctor.py: Module entry point
- tests/test_penny_doctor.py: Complete test suite
- docs/PENNY_DOCTOR.md: Comprehensive documentation
- test_doctor.sh: Implementation validation script
