## 📋 RULES FOR AI ASSISTANTS

When helping with Penny development:

1. ✅ **READ THESE FIRST:**
   - `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Understand where we are
   - `ROADMAP.md` - Understand what's next

2. ✅ **REFERENCE THESE FOR SPECS:**
   - `specs/` - Technical specifications
   - `guides/` - Implementation guides

3. ❌ **NEVER REFERENCE:**
   - `archive/` - Outdated, superseded, or abandoned
   - Root-level docs (being phased out)

4. ❓ **IF CONFUSED:**
   - Ask user: "Which document should I reference?"
   - Check file dates (newer = more likely current)
   - Look for "DEPRECATED" warnings
