# Penny Voice Quality Testing Log
**Started:** September 5, 2025  
**Goal:** Refine voice quality, personality detection, and conversation flow

## Testing Areas

### ðŸŽ­ Voice Quality & Personality
- [ ] **Sassy mode triggers** (sweetie, honey, seriously, adorable)
- [ ] **Tech enthusiast mode** (algorithm, neural, quantum, fascinating) 
- [ ] **Supportive mode** (stressed, worried, help, support)
- [ ] **Playful mode** (haha, funny, silly)
- [ ] **Voice naturalness** (does it sound human?)
- [ ] **Personality expression** (can you hear the sass/enthusiasm?)

### ðŸ’¬ Conversation Flow
- [ ] **Response length** (too long/short?)
- [ ] **Chunking quality** (natural break points?)
- [ ] **Pause timing** (gaps between chunks?)
- [ ] **Speech speed** (too fast/slow?)

### ðŸ”§ Technical Performance  
- [ ] **Synthesis speed** (time to first audio?)
- [ ] **Reliability** (any failures/timeouts?)
- [ ] **Cache effectiveness** (repeated phrases instant?)

## Daily Test Scenarios

### Day 1: Basic Personality Triggers
1. **Sassy test**: "Can you explain quantum physics to me?"
2. **Tech test**: "Tell me about neural networks"  
3. **Support test**: "I'm really stressed about work"
4. **Playful test**: "That was a silly mistake I made"

### Day 2: Natural Conversation
1. Ask about weather, current events
2. Have a longer technical discussion
3. Talk about personal topics (family, hobbies)
4. Test interruption/correction handling

### Day 3: Edge Cases
1. Very short responses
2. Very long explanations  
3. Mixed personality triggers in one response
4. Technical jargon vs casual language
