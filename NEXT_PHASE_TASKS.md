**Total Effort:** ~10 hours (under the 15-20 hour estimate!)

**Why This Matters:**
> "Once judgment exists, not every subsystem has to be perfect. Week 8.5 fundamentally changes the risk profile." - ChatGPT External Review

**All future learning is now PROTECTED:**
- ✅ Hebbian Learning won't learn from vague inputs
- ✅ Outcome Tracking gets clear, unambiguous data
- ✅ Goal Continuity has well-defined tasks
- ✅ User Model builds correct beliefs

- Example: problem → clarification → solution
- Predicts next conversation states
- 500 lines of code

**Integration (14 tests)**
- All 3 components working together
- Data persistence validated
- Performance: 5ms overhead (<10ms target)
- Statistics and export functions

**Total:** ~1,280 lines of production code, 75 tests, 138 total with Week 8.5

**Final Commit:** 526d61e - "Week 9 Hebbian Learning - Core Components Complete"

Penny: "Quick check—which thing specifically?"

User: "Delete all test data"
Penny: "Wanna make sure I nail this—you mean ALL items?"

User: "What's 2+2?"
Penny: "4" (no clarification needed)
```

## 💡 PHASE ∞: OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS (Post-Week 18)

### **Continuous Learning System (DEFERRED)**

**Status:** Reviewed by external experts, consensus reached

**External Review Consensus:**
- ✅ Strategic direction is correct (2026 trends validated)
- ⏸️ Defer full system to post-Week 18
- 🔄 Start with minimal approach if needed

**Current Approach:**
- **Phase 0 (NOW):** Use Penny as research assistant
  - You find papers/repos manually
  - Penny summarizes and compares
  - 0 new code, works today

**Future Options (post-Week 18):**
- **If needed:** Build minimal AI digest tool (2-3 hours)
  - Weekly script, manual trigger
  - 2-3 curated sources
  - Penny summarizes
  - No scoring, no auto-roadmap

**Decision Point:** After Week 13
- Evaluate if manual scanning + Penny works
- Build minimal version if gaps identified
- Full system only if minimal proves valuable

**Reviews:**
- Perplexity: "Defer to post-Week 18, start minimal"
- ChatGPT: "Minimal PoC first, full pipeline later"
- Both: "Strategic fit is good, timing is early"
