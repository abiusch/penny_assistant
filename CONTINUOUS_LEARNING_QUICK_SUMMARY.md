# CONTINUOUS LEARNING SYSTEM - QUICK SUMMARY FOR REVIEW

## 💡 THE IDEA (30 SECONDS)

Build an autonomous system that keeps Penny informed about emerging AI developments without chasing hype.

**Core insight:** In 2026, smaller models + better orchestration > bigger models with worse coordination.

---

## 🎯 WHY NOW?

**Four 2026 trends we're seeing:**
1. Smaller models outperforming big ones (in the right role)
2. Orchestration quality matters more than model size
3. Enterprises "de-LLM-ifying" parts of their stacks
4. "Agent everything" hype cooling fast

**Penny is already aligned** - uses 30B local model, judgment-based orchestration, hybrid architecture (rules + LLM).

> Effort: 2-3 weeks  
> Your call?"

## ❓ KEY QUESTIONS

1. **Is this necessary?** Or is manual scanning sufficient?
2. **Right timing?** Week 14.5 (after core complete) or different?
3. **Does it align?** With Penny's focused, intentional philosophy?
4. **What are risks?** Shiny object syndrome? Noise vs signal?
5. **Better alternatives?** Different approach to staying current?

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE'RE ASKING

**Please evaluate:**
- Strategic fit with Penny's philosophy
- Proposed timing (Week 14.5)
- Architecture soundness
- Value vs maintenance burden
- Potential risks and mitigations

**Vote:**
- 👍 Green light (implement as Week 14.5)
- ⚠️ Do differently (specify changes)
- ⏸️ Defer (until when?)
- 👎 Don't do (why not + alternative?)
