# üéØ Penny Personality Training - Conversation Prompts

**Goal:** Help Penny reach 0.65 confidence threshold (currently at 0.30-0.34)
**Needed:** 15-20 more conversations with consistent patterns
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks of daily use

---

## üìä What Penny Is Learning

After these conversations, Penny will adapt to:
- Your communication style (formal vs casual)
- Your preferred vocabulary and terminology
- Your technical depth preference
- Your response length preference
- Your humor style
- Time-of-day patterns
- Context-specific behaviors

---

## üé≠ **Category 1: Communication Style (5-7 conversations)**

**Goal:** Establish your formality level and vocabulary preferences

### **Casual Tech Questions:**
```
1. "yo penny, can you help me refactor this function?"
2. "what's your take on tabs vs spaces? ngl I'm a spaces person"
3. "this code is a mess fr, how would you clean it up?"
4. "can you review this? lmk if it looks good or if there's issues"
5. "sup - quick question about this API design"
6. "nah that approach won't work, got any other ideas?"
7. "tbh I'm not sure about this pattern, what do you think?"
```

**Why these work:**
- Consistent casual language ("yo", "sup", "ngl", "fr", "tbh", "lmk")
- Mix of questions and statements
- Tech-focused (establishes your primary use case)
- Shows your natural communication style

---

## üíª **Category 2: Technical Depth (5-7 conversations)**

**Goal:** Establish how detailed you want technical explanations

### **Detailed Technical Questions:**
```
1. "can you explain the difference between composition and inheritance with examples?"
2. "walk me through how async/await works under the hood"
3. "what are the trade-offs between REST and GraphQL APIs? give me specifics"
4. "explain database indexing - I want to understand the performance implications"
5. "how does garbage collection work in Python? include memory management details"
6. "break down this algorithm's time complexity for me step by step"
7. "what's the best way to handle error propagation in async code? show me patterns"
```

**Why these work:**
- Explicitly ask for depth ("walk me through", "under the hood", "specifics")
- Technical subjects you care about
- Requests for examples and explanations
- Shows you want detailed, thorough responses

---

## üé® **Category 3: Humor & Personality (3-5 conversations)**

**Goal:** Establish you like dry wit and sarcasm, not enthusiasm

### **Playful/Sarcastic Interactions:**
```
1. "tell me a programming joke - and make it actually funny"
2. "roast my code" [share some messy code]
3. "give me your hot take on JavaScript frameworks"
4. "what's the worst programming advice you've heard?"
5. "be honest - how bad is this approach?" [share questionable code]
```

**Why these work:**
- Invites humor and personality
- Shows you appreciate snark
- Requests opinions (not just facts)
- Establishes conversational, not transactional relationship

---

## üîß **Category 4: Practical Coding (5-7 conversations)**

**Goal:** Reinforce vocabulary and establish you're a developer

### **Real Work Scenarios:**
```
1. "I need to refactor this legacy function - where should I start?"
2. "can you help me optimize this database query? it's slow af"
3. "review this PR for me - does the logic look solid?"
4. "I'm debugging a race condition, any ideas what to look for?"
5. "help me design a caching strategy for this API"
6. "this function needs better error handling - suggestions?"
7. "I'm refactoring our auth system, what patterns would you use?"
```

**Why these work:**
- Consistent vocabulary ("refactor", "optimize", "review")
- Real problems developers face
- Establishes your role/context
- Shows ongoing relationship (not one-off questions)

---

## üåÖ **Category 5: Time-of-Day Patterns (Ongoing)**

**Goal:** Establish different moods/needs at different times

### **Morning (Before Noon):**
```
1. "morning - quick question: [brief technical question]"
2. "hey, need a fast answer on [topic]"
3. "quick review of this code?"
```

**Afternoon (Noon-5pm):**
```
1. "can you help me work through this problem? got time for details"
2. "I'm stuck on this architecture decision, let's think through it"
3. "detailed explanation of [topic] please"
```

**Evening (After 5pm):**
```
1. "wrap up question: [topic]"
2. "last thing for today - thoughts on [approach]?"
3. "quick evening check: does this make sense?"
```

**Why these work:**
- Different interaction styles per time
- Establishes patterns Penny can learn
- Shows your work rhythm

---

## üéØ **Category 6: Vocabulary Reinforcement (Ongoing)**

**Goal:** Consistently use specific terms so Penny learns preferences

### **Key Terms to Use Consistently:**

**Code Review Terms:**
```
- "refactor" (not "rewrite" or "change")
- "LGTM" (looks good to me)
- "nit" (small issue)
- "blocker" vs "non-blocker"
```

**Casual Expressions:**
```
- "ngl" (not gonna lie)
- "fr" (for real)
- "tbh" (to be honest)
- "lmk" (let me know)
- "imo" (in my opinion)
```

**Technical Terms:**
```
- "optimize" vs "refactor" (choose one consistently!)
- "bug" vs "issue" (choose one)
- "function" vs "method" (choose one)
```

**Important:** Be consistent! If you say "refactor" 15 times and "rewrite" 2 times, Penny learns "refactor" is your preference.

## üìÖ **Sample 2-Week Plan**

### **Week 1: Establish Baseline**

**Day 1-2 (4 conversations):**
- 2 casual tech questions
- 2 detailed technical questions

**Day 3-4 (4 conversations):**
- 2 practical coding scenarios
- 1 humor/personality interaction
- 1 casual tech question

**Day 5-7 (6 conversations):**
- 3 practical coding scenarios
- 2 detailed technical questions
- 1 humor interaction

**Week 1 Total:** 14 conversations
**Expected Confidence:** 0.45-0.55

---

### **Week 2: Reinforce & Cross Threshold**

**Day 8-10 (6 conversations):**
- 3 practical coding (use vocabulary consistently!)
- 2 detailed technical
- 1 time-of-day variation

**Day 11-14 (8-10 conversations):**
- 4 practical coding
- 2 detailed technical
- 2 humor/personality
- 2 time-of-day variations

**Week 2 Total:** 14-16 conversations
**Combined Total:** 28-30 conversations
**Expected Confidence:** 0.65-0.75 ‚Üê **THRESHOLD CROSSED!**

---

## üéä **What You'll Notice When Threshold Is Crossed**

### **Before (Confidence < 0.65):**
```
You: "what up penny?"
Penny: "I'm still online and ready to answer questions."
‚Üê Generic, formal, no personality adaptation
```

### **After (Confidence ‚â• 0.65):**
```
You: "what up penny?"
Penny: "Not much. What's up with you?"
‚Üê Casual, mirrors your style, natural
```

### **Code Reviews:**
```
Before: "I suggest you modify this code to improve readability."
After: "You could refactor this to make it cleaner."
‚Üê Uses YOUR vocabulary ("refactor")
```

### **Technical Explanations:**
```
Before: [Brief, surface-level explanation]
After: [Detailed, in-depth explanation with examples]
‚Üê Matches YOUR preference for depth
```

---

## üí° **Pro Tips**

### **Do:**
- ‚úÖ Be consistent with vocabulary
- ‚úÖ Use natural language (how you actually talk)
- ‚úÖ Mix question types (tech, casual, humor)
- ‚úÖ Have real conversations, not just tests
- ‚úÖ Use the web interface (better experience)

### **Don't:**
- ‚ùå Switch vocabulary randomly
- ‚ùå Try to "trick" the system
- ‚ùå Only ask test questions
- ‚ùå Expect instant changes (patience!)
- ‚ùå Use formal language if you're casual (or vice versa)

---

## üìä **Tracking Progress**

Watch for these indicators in the web interface:

```
üé≠ Formality: 0.40 ‚Üí Watch this increase with more data
üß† Tech: 0.50 ‚Üí Watch this adjust to your preference
üìö Terms: 59 ‚Üí Watch this grow as you talk more
```

**Console Output to Look For:**
```
üé≠ Personality-enhanced prompt applied (length: 1242 chars)
üé® Response post-processed: vocabulary_substitution, formality_adjustment
```

Once you see "vocabulary_substitution" and "formality_adjustment" in the console, **adaptations are being applied!**

---

## üéØ **Quick Start (Today)**

**Right now, have these 3 conversations:**

1. **Establish casual tone:**
   ```
   "hey penny, quick question - what's your take on TypeScript vs JavaScript? 
   ngl I'm conflicted"
   ```

2. **Establish technical depth:**
   ```
   "can you explain async/await in detail? I want to understand how it works 
   under the hood, not just surface level"
   ```

3. **Establish vocabulary:**
   ```
   "help me refactor this function [paste code]. It works but it's messy and 
   could be cleaner. LGTM when you're done"
   ```

**After these 3, you'll be at 17 conversations total.**
**Only 13-18 more to go!**

---

## üéä **Summary**

### **Goal:**
Get from 0.30 confidence ‚Üí 0.65 confidence (threshold)

### **How:**
- 15-20 more conversations (total ~28-35)
- Consistent vocabulary and style
