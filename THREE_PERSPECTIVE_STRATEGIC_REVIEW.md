---

## üîç **Areas of Divergence (Differences in Emphasis)**

### **1. Context Segmentation Priority**

**ChatGPT (NEW Feature - HIGH Priority):**
```
"Context Segmentation Layer: Split memory into domains 
(Work, Personal, Creative) with separate personality profiles."

Priority: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (HIGH)
Effort: 8-10 hours
Impact: Prevents personality cross-contamination
```

**Perplexity (Not Mentioned):**
No specific recommendation for context segmentation

**Claude (Acknowledged but Lower Priority):**
Mentioned as Phase 4+ feature

**Analysis:**
- ChatGPT sees this as critical for multi-context users
- Others see it as advanced feature
- Gap: Not in current PHASE3_ROADMAP.md

**Recommendation:**
- **ADD to Phase 3B** as priority feature
- Critical for users who use Penny across contexts
- Prevents work Penny bleeding into personal Penny
- Relatively quick implementation (8-10 hours)

---

### **2. Culture Plugin Architecture**

**ChatGPT (NEW Feature - MEDIUM Priority):**
```
"Culture Plugin Architecture: Modular culture packs that 
refresh quarterly with new slang, references, trends."

Priority: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (MEDIUM)
Effort: 6-8 hours
Impact: Keeps Penny current without retraining
```

**Example:**
```json
// slang_en-US_2025_Q4.json
{
  "emerging_terms": ["lowkey", "no cap", "fr fr"],
  "deprecated_terms": ["on fleek", "lit", "yeet"],
  "cultural_updates": {
    "tech": ["AI agents", "LLM", "RAG"],
    "gaming": ["Elden Ring DLC", "Baldur's Gate 3"]
  }
}
```

**Others:**
- Perplexity: Not mentioned

levels, normalize to prevent personality drift to extremes."

Priority: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (MEDIUM-HIGH)
Effort: 4-6 hours
Impact: Prevents drift over months of use
```

**Problem:**
```
After 50 stressed conversations: Penny becomes overly sympathetic
After 50 sarcastic conversations: Penny becomes overly sarcastic
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Track baseline, normalize to prevent drift
if current_sarcasm > (baseline * 1.5):
    apply_correction()  # Bring back toward baseline
```

**Others:**
- Perplexity: Not mentioned
- Claude: Not mentioned

**Analysis:**
- Addresses long-term stability concern

**ChatGPT:**
> "By approximately 20-25 total sessions" (implies similar timeline)

**Roadmap (PHASE3_ROADMAP.md):**
> "Week 1: Extensive Phase 2 testing"  
> "Weeks 2-6: Phase 3 implementation"

**Analysis:**
- All agree on training timeline (2-4 days)
- Roadmap suggests Phase 3 = 6 weeks
- But current training will complete BEFORE Phase 3 starts

**Gap:**
Training completion (2-4 days) doesn't align with "Week 1: testing" in roadmap

**Recommendation:**
- **Revise roadmap timeline:**
  - Days 1-4: Complete training to 0.65 threshold
  - Days 5-7: Test adapted responses
  - Week 2+: Begin Phase 3 implementation
