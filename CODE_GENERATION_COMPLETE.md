- **Security Stress Testing**: 4/4 tests passed (100% success rate)
- **Total Test Coverage**: 16/16 tests passed across all categories

## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### 🔧 Core Components
1. **CodeGenerationToolServer**: Main MCP tool server with 12 operations
2. **CodeExecutionSandbox**: Isolated execution environment with resource limits
3. **CodeGenerationEngine**: Template-based code generation from natural language
4. **Security Integration**: Full integration with 9-component security architecture

### 🛠️ Key Operations Implemented
- `generate_code` - Natural language to code translation
- `execute_code_sandboxed` - Safe code execution with isolation
- `analyze_existing_code` - Structure analysis and complexity assessment
- `validate_code_syntax` - AST-based syntax validation
- `create_test_cases` - Automated test generation
- `suggest_improvements` - Code enhancement recommendations
- `check_security_compliance` - Security validation
- `propose_system_enhancement` - Controlled self-improvement workflow

## 🎆 Autonomous Learning Capabilities

### 🧠 What Penny Can Now Do
1. **Generate Code from Specifications**: Convert natural language requirements into working code
2. **Test Code Safely**: Execute code in isolated sandbox without system risk
3. **Analyze & Improve**: Assess code structure and suggest enhancements
4. **Learn from Errors**: Adapt and improve based on execution feedback
5. **Propose Enhancements**: Suggest system improvements with approval workflow
6. **Operate Securely**: All operations validated through production security architecture

### 🔄 Learning Workflow Demonstrated
```
1. Identify Need → 2. Generate Code → 3. Validate Security →
4. Execute Tests → 5. Analyze Results → 6. Propose Enhancement →
7. User Approval → 8. Implementation
```
