User: "be more sassy" (Context: conversation with Josh)
Penny: "Sass level changed to SPICY! üß† I'm learning that you prefer spicy sass in this context."

APPLICATION PHASE (Later sessions):
User: "This bug is driving me crazy" (Context: programming, frustrated)
Penny: [Automatically uses minimal sass] "Let me help you debug this systematically."

User: "What do you think about Josh?" (Context: conversation with Josh)
Penny: [Automatically uses spicy sass] "Oh, Josh? Your coding buddy who probably writes comments like 'this works, don't touch it'?"

INSIGHT PHASE:
User: "sass insights"
Penny: "üß† Here's what I've learned about your sass preferences:
   ‚Ä¢ programming:frustrated - minimal sass (very confident)
   ‚Ä¢ conversation:neutral:josh - spicy sass (confident)
   I use these patterns to choose my default sass level, but you can always override me!"
